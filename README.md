RollenspielProzess
==================


This product was initialized by a group of students, working on it as a high school project. <br/>
The product is used to learn the idea of BPMN with a roleplay. <br/>
It is especially interesting for departments who want to record their internal processes.<br/>
The project mainly consists of three parts: <br/>
1. The generation and presentation of the BPMN <br/>
It consists of an API which can be used to create selected parts of the BPMN2.0 specification. <br/>
The generated elements are presented dynamically on a Web-GUI. <br/>
The presentation is made by an external library,<br/>
but in the background there is a self-written grid system used which is performing the positioning of the elements. <br/>
2. The wizard <br/>
The wizard is a Web-GUI in which the participants of the project can fill in the data of their process step. <br/>
Those information are creating new BPMN elements. This makes it possible to see the development of a BPMN-chart <br/>
live during the roleplay <br/>
3. The settings <br>
Some data needs to be persisted before a roleplay is started. <br/>
There is a Web-GUI that gives the possibility to persist data stored in an XML-File. <br/>
Additional functionalities of the Web-GUI are used to guide a roleplay. <br/>
