RollenspielProzess
==================


This product was initialized by a group of students, working on it as a high school project. The product is used to learn the idea of BPMN with a roleplay. It is especially interesting for departments who want to record their internal processes.
The project mainly consists of three parts: 
1. The generation and presentation of the BPMN. 
It consists of an API which can be used to create selected parts of the BPMN2.0 specification. The generated elements are presented dynamically on a Web-GUI. The presentation is made by an external library, but in the background there is a self-written grid system used which is performing the positioning of the elements. 
2. The wizard. 
The wizard is a Web-GUI in which the participants of the project can fill in the data of their process step. Those information are creating new BPMN elements. This makes it possible to see the development of a BPMN-chart live during the roleplay 
3. The settings. 
Some data needs to be persisted before a roleplay is started. There is a Web-GUI that gives the possibility to persist data stored in an XML-File. Additional functionalities of the Web-GUI are used to guide a roleplay
